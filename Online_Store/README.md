In this Java program, I created two graphical user interfaces, one which coresponds for an admin to add, delete or modify catgegories or products and one which corespondsfor a simple user that can order the product.
I use some OOP concepts, but this is a beginer level.The saved results for both interfaces are stored using serialization
